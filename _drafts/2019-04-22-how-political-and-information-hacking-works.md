There has been a lot of hubbub regarding Russians hacking the election in 2016 and a fair amount of fear. My goal is to ensure you understand, better, how the kind of hacking and influence we saw in 2016 as well as other information gathering most often works.

To anyone who wants to be the next super hacker, you've come to the wrong place. I won't be exposing any cutting edge techniques or fantastic tools. My aim is to bring awareness to what hacking looks like and why it is so important to understanding what happened in the last presidential election and how attacks are typically executed, even against individuals.

## Intro ##

There are many computer security experts in the world and they typically get paid large sums of money to help companies keep their information safe from people who would be interested in damaging the company or the people who purchase goods and/or services from the company.

There are many technicaly aspects of securing a company network, but most of these are not particularly useful to individuals.  What we are going to explore are the kinds of hacks which are used to target individuals and their information with a special focus on manipulating voters.

We will look at three common tactics which are used to great effect against people every day: phishing, bots, and social engineering. Each of these techniques opts for compromising the person rather than the computer. This means you are more at risk for being human than whether there is a security issue with your computer.

It's likely youm dear reader, are already familiar with the names of two of the three attacks on my list. Phishing has been and continues to be an effective way to gain access to accounts and private accounts of individuals.  Bots, however, are not exactly what you think.  Rather than being a fake account which may, or may not have a real person attached to it, posting on social media, bots are a bit of software which can do nearly anything.

We will take a look at both phishing and bots, as well as social engineering momentarily.
